# Tom Tom codility tests


These are the tests as best I can remember them. I was definitely not prepared for the level of complexity involved. Anyway, here are two solutions that fit what I remember. 

To build and rum them

```shell
$ cd Problem\ 1/
$ make
$ ./build/app
```

```shell
$ cd Problem\ 2/
$ make
$ ./build/app
```
